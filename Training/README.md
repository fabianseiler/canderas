# Training Process Overview


## General Information

As this project is part of an ongoing research collaboration, the dataset can not be shared online.


## Training Process

To train the proposed Networks on a dataset with synthetic anomalies, just execute the `train_modely.py` script. We recommend training on a cuda compatible GPU.
The models and hyperparameter must be adjusted to individual needs.
